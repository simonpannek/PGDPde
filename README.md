## Run locally

If you want to run the website locally, run `npm install` to install all dependencies and then `npm start` to generate and serve the site (run `npm build` if you just want to build).

## Contributing

### Add another Tutor
If you want to add another tutor, just add your file to the folder /src/tutors/ using a pull request (for a template, check out the `template.md` file). Your file should have the name `lastname-firstname.md`.

Notes:
- Before opening a pull request, check whether your changes have the right syntax and format. This saves me a lot of time.
- Please do not add tutors on this site without their agreement.
- If you want content to be removed from this site, open a new pull request or message me.

If you need any additional help, feel free to contact me [here](https://simonpannek.com/home/contact/).

### Design changes
If you have any ideas for additional features, just open up an issue. In case you want to implement it yourself, message me first (just to make sure you do not waste your time).
